# JSFinder
JSFinder is a Python tool that automates the discovery of JavaScript files across subdomains. It fetches and parses HTML content from each subdomain to identify linked JavaScript files, saving the results to an output file. The script also includes a verbose mode for detailed scanning feedback. Ideal for security researchers and developers.
